Hi, I'm Moreno La Quatra <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30">

*I spend my days trying to move things closer if they're similar, and further apart otherwise. Coincidentally, this aligns with ML/DL.*

I'm an Assistant Professor in AI and Machine Learning at [STMLab](https://github.com/K-STMLab), Università degli Studi di Enna "Kore". 
My research focus:
- 📝 NLP
- 🔉 speech and audio processing
-  🖼️ multimodal learning.

I'm particularly interested in how machines can understand both general audio content and spoken language – things like new architectures for audio understanding, pathological voice analysis, and expressive speech modeling.

---

🚀 I actively collaborate on research in speech-based DL. If you're passionate about **audio representation learning**, **spoken content analysis**, or **multilingual/multimodal learning**, please don't hesitate to reach out.

**For master's students:** If you're curious about these areas, I have [thesis proposals](https://github.com/MorenoLaQuatra/master-thesis-proposals) available and I'm happy to discuss about research-driven projects.
