Hi, I'm Moreno La Quatra <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30">

<br/>

🎓 I'm an **Assistant Professor** in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at [STMLab](https://github.com/K-STMLab), Università degli Studi di Enna "Kore".

My research focuses on:

- 📝 Natural Language Processing
- 🔉 Speech and Audio Processing
- 🖼️ Multimodal Learning


I’m particularly interested in how machines can understand and process both **general audio content** and **spoken language** i.e. new architecture that push forward audio understanding, pathological voice analysis, expressive speech modeling.

🚀 I actively collaborate on research in speech-based DL. If you're passionate about **audio representation learning**, **spoken content analysis**, or **multilingual/multimodal learning**, feel free to reach out.

🎓 Are you a master's student curious about these fields?  
Take a look at my [thesis proposals](https://github.com/MorenoLaQuatra/master-thesis-proposals) — I’m always happy to mentor motivated students on research-driven projects.
