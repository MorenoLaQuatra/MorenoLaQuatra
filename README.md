I'm a post-doc researcher at [DBDMG@PoliTO](https://dbdmg.polito.it/dbdmg_web/). I'm the teaching assistant for the [Deep NLP](https://github.com/MorenoLaQuatra/DeepNLP) course (semester: Sep-Feb).

- I’m interested in 📝 NLP, 🔉 Audio processing and 🖼️ Multimodal Learning.
- If you are a master student 👨‍🎓 👩‍🎓 interested in some of the fields above, you may want to take a look to [this repo](https://github.com/MorenoLaQuatra/master-thesis-proposals).
- I'm looking to collaborate on the analysis of spoken content 🗣️, get in touch if you are interested!
